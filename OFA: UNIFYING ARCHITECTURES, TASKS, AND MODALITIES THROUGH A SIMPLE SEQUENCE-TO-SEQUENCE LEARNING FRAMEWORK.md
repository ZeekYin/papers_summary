# What is OFA
OFA is an acronym for Once-for-All, a machine learning framework that aims to train one network that can support diverse architectural settings and tasks. According to the web search results¹, OFA is based on a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture that can handle different modalities such as text and image. OFA uses a unified vocabulary and instruction-based learning to simplify the pretraining and finetuning stages. OFA claims to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal and unimodal tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering, text-to-image generation, and more. OFA was proposed by researchers from Alibaba Group in 2022¹.

# What is unified in this framework?
According to the web search results², OFA is a unified framework that unifies three aspects: architectures, tasks, and modalities. Architectures refer to the Transformer encoder-decoder structure that can process different types of data without extra components. Tasks refer to the instruction-based learning paradigm that can handle various cross-modal and unimodal tasks with a simple sequence-to-sequence format. Modalities refer to the unified vocabulary and representation that can encode text, image, and object information in a shared space. OFA aims to simplify the pretraining and finetuning stages and achieve high performance on diverse tasks and modalities.

# is OFA unified pictures and words to a single representation form?
Yes, OFA unifies pictures and words to a single representation form by using a unified vocabulary and embedding. OFA uses ResNet modules to extract patch features from images and byte-pair encoding to tokenize text. Then, both image and text features are embedded into the same hidden size and share the same position embeddings. OFA also uses discrete codes to represent image patches and location tokens to represent object bounding boxes. All these tokens are part of the unified vocabulary that OFA can process with the Transformer encoder-decoder architecture.

# Can I just believe that, the ResNet just plays a row as a converter, which converts picture to a kind of "word"?
That's a good way to think about it. ResNet is a convolutional neural network that can extract high-level features from images. OFA uses ResNet to divide an image into patches and convert each patch into a feature vector of the same hidden size as the text embeddings. You can think of these feature vectors as "words" that represent the visual information of the image patches. OFA then embeds these feature vectors into the same space as the text embeddings and processes them with the Transformer encoder-decoder. So ResNet acts as a converter that transforms images into a sequence of "words" that OFA can understand and generate.

# OFA then embeds these feature vectors into the same space as the text embeddings and processes them with the Transformer encoder-decoder. If I consider these picture feature vectors as word/sentence embedding, can I just believe that the transformer part of OFA is just treating with words? just like traditional transformer-family model(t5,bert, gpt, etc.)?
Yes, you can think of the Transformer part of OFA as a general sequence-to-sequence model that can handle both text and image features as words. OFA uses the same Transformer architecture as T5, BERT and GPT, but with an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder takes the input sequence, which can be a combination of text and image features, and produces a contextualized representation. The decoder takes the encoder output and an instruction as input and generates the output sequence, which can also be a combination of text and image features. OFA uses the same attention mechanism and feed-forward network as T5, BERT and GPT, but with some modifications such as relative position bias and head scaling to improve performance. So OFA is essentially a Transformer model that can process multimodal data in a unified way.

# OFA is a structure which can handle both picture and sentence. For the sentence part, OFA treats it like a normal Transformer model, but for the picture part, OFA first pass the picture to a ResNet. the ResNet will divide the picture into patches, and finally convert these patches to embeddings which is similar to the sentence. Therefore, the OFA's transformer part can handle these picture information like normal sentences. Is my comprehension right?
The only part of your comprehension that was not accurate was that you said OFA converts the image patches to embeddings that are similar to the sentence. This is not exactly true, because OFA does not use the same embeddings for image patches and text tokens. Instead, OFA uses discrete codes to represent image patches, which are different from text tokens. Discrete codes are learned from a codebook that maps each code to a feature vector. OFA can generate and understand these codes as part of its unified vocabulary. Discrete codes are useful for image generation and compression tasks, because they can represent images in a compact and meaningful way. Location tokens are another type of tokens that OFA uses to represent object bounding boxes. Location tokens are integers that correspond to the coordinates of the object regions. OFA can generate and understand these tokens as well, which are useful for visual grounding and object detection tasks.

# Could you please explain the Discrete codes which are used in OFA?
Sure. Discrete codes are a way of representing image patches with tokens from a codebook. A codebook is a dictionary that maps each code to a feature vector. For example, if the codebook has 8192 codes, each code can be represented by a 13-bit binary number. Each image patch can then be assigned to the nearest code in the codebook based on some distance metric. This way, an image can be represented by a sequence of discrete codes, which are much shorter and more meaningful than the raw pixel values. OFA can generate and understand these discrete codes as part of its unified vocabulary. Discrete codes are useful for image generation and compression tasks, because they can preserve the visual information of the image in a compact and interpretable way.
